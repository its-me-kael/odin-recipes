    <p>This Frogmore stew can be adjusted to serve any number. I've used this recipe for over 20 years since I moved to South Carolina.</p>
    <p>Allow 2 tablespoons of seasoning per quart of water. If you cannot find hot smoked sausage, use another smoked sausage, such as kielbasa, and add crushed hot red pepper to the pot.</p>
