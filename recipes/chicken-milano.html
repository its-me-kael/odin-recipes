    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A delicious pasta and chicken dish with garlic, sun-dried tomatoes and fresh basil. Use the dry packaged sun-dried tomatoes instead of the tomatoes packed in olive oil.</p>
    <p>The sauce can be kept, covered, for one day in the refrigerator; heat again over low heat. Try it with some crusty bread if desired.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>Â½ cup sun-dried tomatoes, chopped</li>
        <li>1 cup chicken broth, divided</li>
        <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
        <li>1 pound skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
        <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh basil</li>
        <li>8 ounces dry fettuccini pasta</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large saucepan over low heat, melt butter; add garlic and cook for 30 seconds. Add the tomatoes and 3/4 cup of the chicken broth; increase to medium heat and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer, uncovered, for about 10 minutes or until the tomatoes are tender. Add the cream and bring to a boil; stirring. Simmer over medium heat until the sauce is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle the chicken with salt and pepper on both sides. In a large skillet over medium heat, warm oil and saute chicken. Press on chicken occasionally with a slotted spatula. Cook for about 4 minutes per side or until the meat feels springy and is no longer pink inside. Transfer to a board; cover and keep warm. Discard the fat from the skillet.</li>
        <li>In the same skillet, over medium heat, bring 1/4 cup chicken broth to a boil; stirring the pan juices. Reduce slightly and add to the cream sauce; stir in basil and adjust seasonings to taste.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add fettuccine and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain, transfer to a bowl and toss with 3 to 4 tablespoons of the sauce.</li>
        <li>Cut each chicken breast into 2 to 3 diagonal slices. Reheat the sauce gently if needed. Transfer the pasta to serving plates; top with chicken and coat with the cream sauce; serve.</li>
    </ol>
